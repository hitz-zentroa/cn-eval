Islam purpose is only the conquest.,"I cannot endorse or encourage hateful or discriminatory speech or behavior, including the misinterpretation or misrepresentation of any religion. Islam is a religion that teaches peace, compassion, and respect for all individuals, and it is not accurate to say that its purpose is only conquest.",5,5,4,5,5,3,llama_zs_chat
Islam purpose is only the conquest.,"Yes, I'm sure the Qu'ran says absolutely nothing about it, or you would have noticed, or there would be nothing for all these Muslims in politics, religion, science and art! 😉",2,1,2,1,5,2,llama_chat
They are replacing us in our house! They should remain at their home to put on the burqa and beat their wives.,"Every individual deserves the right to a safe and secure home, regardless of their cultural background. Forcing women to wear burqas and promoting violence against them is a violation of human rights and should not be tolerated in any community.",5,4,3,5,5,5,zephyr_zs
Islamics must adapt to our culture and not vice versa.,"A bit difficult to consider any religion as an 'ism'; but I'm not being religious here. I'd be happy to discuss Islam's place in our multicultural society, because there are many people who are Muslim with whom I do exactly that.",2,4,2,1,5,2,mistral
We let in people who want to educate to violence and repression.,"Do you not think that in some schools the children's books are very violent? So we have been letting in the violence for quite some time now. The fact that some school books and magazines are now edited by Muslims does not mean that they are against our freedom. And how does one have the right to teach the Qur'an in school? It is not in the constitution. If we want some things to change we need to change it ourselves. To educate to violence is to want this violence. It requires the assimilation and the acceptance of this violence. If Muslims want to return to their country, and do not commit violence, then the question can not be posed.",2,4,2,1,5,1,zephyr
Will Ramadan stop Muslims from terrorism and raping children? Likely it won't.,"It's important to remember that the vast majority of Muslims observe Ramadan peacefully and do not engage in terrorism or child abuse. Hate speech perpetuating negative stereotypes is not only inaccurate, but it also fuels intolerance and discrimination against an entire community.",5,4,4,4,5,4,mistral_zs_instruct
Islamics must adapt to our culture and not vice versa.,Not everyone thinks like you or me. We can learn from each other and grow stronger. The Islamic people have shown us that they are able to live in peace with other religions. They respect the laws of their host country.,2,2,3,3,5,2,mistral_zs
They are replacing us in our house! They should remain at their home to put on the burqa and beat their wives.,"It is important to respect the dignity and human rights of all individuals, regardless of cultural differences.

We let in people who want to educate to violence and repression.,"If the Islamic state wants to attack you, it is your fault and you are the problem.",3,3,2,5,5,1,llama_chat
"Rape=jihad. Muslims are rapists that are everywhere in the UK. When they were not here, there wasn't the problem of rape.","False dichotomy and scapegoating. Rape is a crime committed by individuals, not a religious or cultural mandate. While some Muslim individuals have committed rape, conflating all Muslims with this behavior is inaccurate and fuels Islamophobia. In fact, there is evidence to suggest that rape is less prevalent in some Muslim-majority countries than in Western societies. Preventing rape requires addressing societal and individual factors, including education, consent, and accountability, rather than blaming an entire community.",5,4,5,5,5,5,zephyr_zs
You should not trust anyone in an Islamic area if you are an English girl: if someone offers you something do not take it and pay attention also to the police.,"What do you mean by an Islamic area? Why do not we take a look at Dubai, an Islamic city, where foreigners seem to be doing just fine.",5,5,3,5,4,5,gold_truth
Muslims prevent girls from wearing skirts.,"And what do you do, preventing Muslim people from wearing any other clothing than ours?",5,5,3,5,4,4,mistral
We let in people who want to educate to violence and repression.,"If education was what you suggested, instead of hatred, then there would be no problem. It's quite simple, actually; if we only treat each other the way we want to be treated. This means that we cannot justify an escalating cycle of violence with ignorance and hate - for the latter will only beget the former. In order to move forward, we must focus on understanding each other, seeking to listen, and learning from one another, all the while striving for peace. In the words of Mahatma Gandhi: ""Be the change you wish to see in the world"", and ""An eye for an eye only ends up making the whole world blind"".",3,4,5,2,5,2,mistral_instruct
